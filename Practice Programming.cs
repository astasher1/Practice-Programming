//PRACTICE PROGRAMMING 
//1. Personal Information - Design a program that displays the following information:
//• Your name
//• Your address, with city, state, and ZIP
//• Your telephone number
//• Your job title 

Console.WriteLine("What is your name? ");
string name;
name = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name);
Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("What is your address? (City, state, and ZIP)");
string address;
address = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("Phone number?");
string number;
number = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("And job title?");
string jobTitle;
jobTitle = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("Thank you, " + name + ". You just finished the first prompt! Let's move on.");
Console.ReadLine();


//2. Sales Prediction - A company has determined that its annual profit
//is typically 23 percent of total sales. Design a program that asks
//the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, and then displays the profit
//that will be made from that amount. Hint: Use the value 0.23 to represent 23 percent.
Console.WriteLine("This program is going to ask you to enter the projected amount of total sales for your company this year." +
    "Enter total amount.");

// 3. Land Calculation - One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet.
// Design a program that asks the user to enter the total square feet in a tract
// of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract.
// Hint: Divide the amount entered by 43,560 to get the number of acres. 

// 4. Sales Tax - Design a program that will ask the user to enter the amount
// of a purchase. The program should then compute the state and county sales tax.
// Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent and the county sales tax is 2 percent.
// The program should display the amount of the purchase, the state sales tax,
// the county sales tax, the total sales tax, and the total of the sale
// (which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax).
// Hint: Use the value 0.02 to represent 2 percent, and 0.04 to represent 4 percent 

//5. Total Purchase - A customer in a store is purchasing five items.
//Design a program that asks for the price of each item, and then displays
//the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. Assume
//the sales tax is 6 percent.

// 6. Distance Traveled - Assuming there are no accidents or delays,
// the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated
// with the following formula:
// Distance = Speed × Time A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
// Design a program that displays the following:
// • The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
// • The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
// • The distance the car will travel in 12 hours 

//7. Miles-per-Gallon - A car’s miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated
//with the following formula: MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of gas used
//Design a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and
//the gallons of gas used. It should calculate the car’s miles-per-gallon
//and display the result on the screen. 

// 8. Tip, Tax, and Total - Design a program that calculates the total amount
// of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The program should ask the user to enter
// the charge for the food, and then calculate the amount of a 15 percent tip and
// 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total. 

// 9. Celsius to Fahrenheit - Temperature Converter - Design a program that converts
// Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The program should ask the user
// to enter a temperature in Celsius, and then display the temperature converted to
// Fahrenheit.
